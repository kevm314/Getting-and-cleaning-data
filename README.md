- Load the training and testing data as well as metadata including subjects, descriptive activity labels and descriptive features names
- Extract the mean and standard deviation variables across the set of original features
- Merge the training and testing data
- Apply descriptive variable names to the merged dataset
- Produce tidy dataset labelled as tidy.txt which contains the average of every variable for each subject-activity pair
